# Maze Game
A simple game where a hero has to find the exit out of the maze, but first has to kill all the dragons within the labyrinth. This project was developed for the Object-Oriented Programming Laboratory (LPOO) class of the Master in Informatics and Computer Engineering (MIEIC) at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto (FEUP).
